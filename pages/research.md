Broadly, as a computational biologist I have performed research tackling a great variety of questions, ranging from sexual reproduction in plants, yeast genetic studies, to the study of DNA mutations in the human body. 

## Current

My current focus is on **the study of somatic DNA mutations in the human body and its impact on cancer initiation and progression**. This field currently requires the integration of genomic sequencing data with molecular and cellular biology and my current efforts are on finding ways to crystallize this integration.

I have pioneered the development of computational methods and techniques that leverage public genomic data to understand the somatic mutation landscape in the human healthy body. In this project I have had to process and analyze around 10,000 sequencing samples originated from more than 500 people. I have acquired the experience necessary to apply pipelines and statistical analyses to big data in an efficient fashion. I have successfully integrated genomics, transcriptomics and phenotypic data to perform association analysis, which together have uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of somatic mutations in the human body 

## Past

- I led a project where we developed a sequencing technology to understand how sun-induced DNA damage accumulates in the human genome and its relevance to melanoma. This project expanded the current understanding of why and what regions of the human genome are more susceptible to DNA damage. [*Garcia-Nieto PE et. al. EMBO J. 2017*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28814448)

- I worked in high-throughput genetic experiments in yeast, tackling experimental and bioinformatics tasks which led to the completion of a study that shed light to the interplay between chromatin and metabolism.
