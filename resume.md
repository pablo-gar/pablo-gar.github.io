# EDUCATION

## Ph.D. Biology

### 2015 – Present. Stanford University. Stanford, CA.

Molecular, cellular and developmental with a strong computational component

Advisors: Hunter Fraser, Ashby Morrison


## B.Sc. Genomics

### 2009 – 2013. National Autonomous University of Mexico	Mexico City, Mexico.	
With university honors.

Advisor: Jean-Philippe Vielle-Calzada


# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
 
## Ph.D. thesis project 

### 2015 – Present, Fraser lab. Stanford University	Stanford, CA

Working on the application of evolution and population genomics to understand the mutational process in humans. Pioneering computational methods and techniques that leverage public genomic data to understand the somatic mutation landscape in the human healthy body. Integration of genomics, transcriptomics and phenotypic data to perform association analysis, which together have uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of somatic mutations in the human body.

## Research Assistant

### 2013 – 2015 Morrison Lab. Stanford University	Stanford, CA

Worked on investigating how the three-dimensional structure of the genome influences genomic susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation. We developed a novel sequencing technique to map UV-induced DNA lesions. I was in charge of data processing and analysis. By integrating with melanoma mutation data and chromatin data from the roadmap epigenomics project, we were able to unravel the features defining the landscape of carcinogen (UV) susceptibility in the human genome. 

## B.Sc. thesis project

### 2012 – 2011 Vielle-Calzada Lab.National laboratory of genomics for biodiversity	Irapuato, Mexico

Worked on the application of functional genomics through computational biology to investigate sexual development in plants. I processed and analyzed small-RNA sequencing data obtained from plant ovules.
             
## Research internship

### 2010 – 2011 	National Autonomous University of Mexico	Mexico City, Mexico

Worked in the Esperanza Martinez’s lab at UNAM on the Mechanisms of Gram-negative bacteria competition.
