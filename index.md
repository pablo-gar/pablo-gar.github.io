### In a few words

Professionally, I have a passion on using data to find solutions to complex problems with a particular interest in biological systems. I'm a big supporter of open and democratic science and I'm optimistic that its impacts and devlopment can reach *almost* everyone. 

I consider myself a computational biologist having a strong background on the analysis of big data in biology, specifically in the *omics* range.


Personally, you can find me trying to improve my dancing skills (cumbia, salsa, and swing), in the soccer field, doing amateur photograhy, reading at a cafe, or having a beer with friends. 

### Research
Broadly, as a computational biologist I have performed research tackling a great variety of questions, ranging from sexual reproduction in plants to the study of DNA mutations in the human body. 

#### Current

My current focus is on the study of somatic DNA mutations in the human body and its impact in cancer initiation and progression. This field currently requires the integration of genomic sequencing data with molecular and cellular biology and my current efforts are on finding ways to crystallize this integration.

I have pioneered the development of computational methods and techniques that leverage public genomic data to understand the somatic mutation landscape in the human healthy body. In this project I have had to process and analyze around 10,000 sequencing samples originated from more than 500 people. I have acquired the experience necessary to apply pipelines and statistical analyses to big data in an efficient fashion. I have successfully integrated genomics, transcriptomics and phenotypic data to perform association analysis, which together have uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of somatic mutations in the human body 

#### Past

- I led a project where we developed a sequencing technology to understand how sun-induced DNA damage accumulates in the human genome and its relevance to melanoma. This project expanded the current understanding of why and what regions of the human genome are more susceptible to DNA damage. [*Garcia-Nieto PE et. al. EMBO J. 2017*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28814448)

- I worked in high-throughput genetic experiments in yeast, tackling experimental and bioinformatics tasks which led to the completion of a study that shed light to the interplay between chromatin and metabolism. [*Beckwith SL, Schwartz EK, García-Nieto PE, et al. PLoS Gen. 2018*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462149)

### Personal interests

#### Dancing
I've been dancing cumbia my entire life but since the cumbia scene in the Bay Area is not big I just recently (2018) started exploring salsa and bachata. 

At the beginning of 2019 I fell in love with Lindy Hope, it's been a long ride but it just get more addictive every day!

#### Soccer
About 3 to 5 times a week you can find me playing some sort of soccer. You name it, pick-up, a coed league, a competetive Bar Area league, and futsol. Fun fact, I didn't get really good until after I was 22 years old.

#### Reading
I always have pair of books, a fiction and a non-fiction one. My last combination is the Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison (I'm trying to explore more american literature) and The Undoing Project by Micheal Lewis. 

#### Simple photogragy
I've been teaching myself photograpgy from scratch, for a true begginner the internet is great source to learn almos anything to a decent state. I will upload some of my favorites photos soon.
