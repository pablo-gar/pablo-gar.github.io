### In a few words

Professionally, I have a passion on using data to find solutions to complex problems with a particular interest in biological systems. I'm a big supporter of open and democratic science and I'm optimistic that its impacts and development can reach *almost* everyone. 

I am a computational biologist with a strong background on analysis of big data in biology, specifically in the *omics* range.


Personally, you can find me trying to improve my dancing skills (cumbia, salsa, and swing), in the soccer field, doing amateur photography, reading at a cafe, or having a beer with friends.
