### In a few words

Professionally, I have a passion to use data to solve complex problems, I have focused my career on molecular biology but I am generally trained as a data-backed problem solver with a strong background on statistics. 

I am a computational biologist with a experience on analysis of big data in biology, specifically in the *omics* range.

I'm a big supporter of open and democratic science and I'm optimistic that its impacts and development can reach *almost* everyone. 

Personally, if I'm not on the move traveling, you can find me trying to improve my dancing skills (cumbia, salsa, and swing), in the soccer field or on my road bike, doing amateur photography, reading at a cafe, or having a beer with friends.
