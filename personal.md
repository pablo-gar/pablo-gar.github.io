## Dancing
I've been dancing cumbia my entire life but since the cumbia scene in the Bay Area is not big I just recently (2018) started exploring salsa and bachata. 

At the beginning of 2019 I fell in love with Lindy Hope, it's been a long ride but it just get more addictive every day!

## Soccer
About 3 to 5 times a week you can find me playing some sort of soccer. You name it, pick-up, a coed league, a competetive Bar Area league, and futsol. Fun fact, I didn't get really good until after I was 22 years old.

## Reading
I always have pair of books, a fiction and a non-fiction one. My last combination is the Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison (I'm trying to explore more american literature) and The Undoing Project by Micheal Lewis. 

## Simple photogragy
I've been teaching myself photograpgy from scratch, for a true begginner the internet is great source to learn almos anything to a decent state. I will upload some of my favorites photos soon.
